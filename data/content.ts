export const bio = [
  "Hey! I'm Shivam Maji, a sophomore at Santa Clara University studying Computer Engineerng and Mechanical Engineering. I build software, design hardware, and like when the two meet in the middle.",
  "On the CS side, I started out modding Minecraft in Java and making games in Unity. Since then I've moved through frontend work in React, picked up Python for AI and computer vision, messed around with C++ and Kotlin, and trained models in PyTorch and TensorFlow. I like learning whatever the project demands and figuring it out as I go. Hackathons have become my favorite way to build fast, break things, and walk away with something that actually works.",
  "I'm a member of my university's Formula SAE team, where I work on aerodynamics and chassis design using SolidWorks and ANSYS. On the hardware side, I've worked with Verilog and ASIC design.",
  "Huge space nerd. The goal is aerospace — NASA, SpaceX, somewhere with a mission control. I also cook, lift, play chess poorly, and have spent way too much money on camera gear.",
  "Open to internships, collaborations, or a good conversation."
